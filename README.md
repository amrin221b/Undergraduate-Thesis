# Undergraduate Thesis: BER Performance Analysis of FSO Communication System

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis on "BER Performance Analysis of FSO Communication System over Málaga (M) Turbulence Channel with Zero and Non-zero Boresight Pointing Errors for Different Modulation Techniques." The study was completed as part of my B.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at East West University.

## Abstract

The thesis explores the performance of Free Space Optical (FSO) Communication systems, focusing on average bit error rate (ABER) performance under various atmospheric conditions and modulation techniques. By evaluating different modulation schemes like BPSK, DPSK, QPSK, and others, the research aims to identify optimal methods for FSO systems under Málaga (M) distribution models considering atmospheric turbulence, attenuation, and pointing errors.
